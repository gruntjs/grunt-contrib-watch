# grunt-contrib-watch [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)

> Run predefined tasks whenever watched file patterns are added, changed or deleted.

_Note that this plugin has not yet been released, and only works with the latest bleeding-edge, in-development version of grunt. See the [When will I be able to use in-development feature 'X'?](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/devel/docs/faq.md#when-will-i-be-able-to-use-in-development-feature-x) FAQ entry for more information._

## Getting Started
_If you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide._

From the same directory as your project's [Gruntfile][Getting Started] and [package.json][], install this plugin with the following command:

```bash
npm install grunt-contrib-watch --save-dev
```

Once that's done, add this line to your project's Gruntfile:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');
```

If the plugin has been installed correctly, running `grunt --help` at the command line should list the newly-installed plugin's task or tasks. In addition, the plugin should be listed in package.json as a `devDependency`, which ensures that it will be installed whenever the `npm install` command is run.

## The watch-examples task

# Examples

```js
// Simple config to run jshint any time a file is added, changed or deleted
grunt.initConfig({
  watch: {
    files: '**/*',
    tasks: ['jshint']
  }
});
```

```js
// Advanced config. Run specific tasks when specific files are added, changed or deleted.
grunt.initConfig({
  watch: {
    gruntfile: {
      files: 'Gruntfile.js',
      tasks: ['jshint:gruntfile'],
      options: {
        nocase: true
      }
    },
    src: {
      files: ['lib/*.js', 'css/**/*.scss', '!lib/dontwatch.js'],
      tasks: ['default']
    },
    test: {
      files: '<%= jshint.test.src %>',
      tasks: ['jshint:test', 'qunit']
    }
  }
});
```


## The watch-faqs task

# FAQs

## How do I fix the error `EMFILE: Too many opened files.`?
This is because of your system's max opened file limit. For OSX the default is very low (256). Increase your limit with `ulimit -n 10480`, the number being the new max limit. If you're still running into issues then consider setting the option `forceWatchMethod: 'old'` to use the older and slower stat polling watch method.


## The watch-options task

# Settings

There are a number of options available. Please review the [minimatch options here](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#options). As well as some additional options as follows:

## files
Type: `String|Array`

This defines what file patterns this task will watch. Can be a string or an array of files and/or minimatch patterns.

## tasks
Type: `String|Array`

This defines which tasks to run when a watched file event occurs.

## options.interrupt
Type: `boolean`
Default: false

As files are modified this watch task will spawn tasks in child processes. The default behavior will only spawn a new child process per target when the previous process has finished. Set the `interrupt` option to true to terminate the previous process and spawn a new one upon later changes.

Example:
```js
watch: {
  scripts: {
    files: '**/*.js',
    tasks: ['jshint'],
    options: {
      interrupt: true
    }
  }
}
```

## options.debounceDelay
Type: `Integer`
Default: 500

How long to wait before emitting events in succession for the same filepath and status. For example if your `Gruntfile.js` file was `changed`, a `changed` event will only fire again after the given milliseconds.

Example:
```js
watch: {
  scripts: {
    files: '**/*.js',
    tasks: ['jshint'],
    options: {
      debounceDelay: 250
    }
  }
}
```

## options.interval
Type: `Integer`
Default: 100

The `interval` is passed to `fs.watchFile`. Since `interval` is only used by `fs.watchFile` and this watcher also uses `fs.watch`; it is recommended to ignore this option. *Default is 100ms*.

## options.forceWatchMethod
Type: `false|'new'|'old'`
Default: false

Node.js has two file watching methods: 'old' (`fs.watchFile`) which uses stat polling and 'new' (`fs.watch`) which attempts to use the system's built-in watch mechanism. By default, this watch task uses both methods and which ever method responds first will be used for subsequent events.

There may be some setups where you would need to force a specific watch method, such as on networked file system. Set `options.forceWatchMethod: 'old'` to specifically use the old watch method, `fs.watchFile`.


## The watch-overview task

# Overview

Inside your `Gruntfile.js` file, add a section named `watch`. This section specifies the files to watch, tasks to run when an event occurs and the options used.
